# Energize - Monitor your Battery
This application is designed to monitor your battery state and provide useful information about the current charging level, the estimated time to charge or discharge and some more useful information.

## Build the application with [Eclipse][7]
For building the application by yourself follow the following steps:

  1. Clone the application repository

          git clone https://github.com/thuetz/Energize.git
       
  2. Change into the cloned directory

          cd Energize
          
  3. Initialize and update the submodules

          git submodule init
          git submodule update
          
  4. Create an Android project for each submodule using the `Android Project from Existing Code` function of Eclipse
  5. Create an Android project for the actual application (using the `Android Project from Existing Code` function of Eclipse)
  6. Build the application :)
